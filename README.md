# Introduction to Elasticsearch with Python
---
1. You need to create your own ES to be able to run notebook
  - [cloud.elastic.co](https://cloud.elastic.co/logout?redirectTo=%2Fhome&reason=unauthorised) - you can do it here
  - Save login and password, check cloud id
2. You have to install `elasticsearch` library
  - You can download with: `pip3 install elasticsearch` from your terminal or by running `!pip3 install elasticsearch` from inside the notebook
4. Before you start running Elasticsearch notebook, run `list.ipynb` to store `data` list of dictionaries in memory
5. Have fun!
